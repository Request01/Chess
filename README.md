# My chess variant

This will be my own chess variant, but it can be compared to capaplance chess.
It is played on a 10x8 chess board, with additional pieces. 

At first I will create the graphic interface, and after that implement the game dynamics. 
Finally, I will program a chess engine for that variant.
